# zener_diode
A zener diode circuit is such that the output corresponding to an input v s(t)=cos(π*t) is a clipped sinusoid
 Use MATLAB to generate the input and the output signals and plot them in the same plot for 0 ≤ t ≤4 at time intervals of 0.001.

(a)	Is this system linear? Compare the output obtained from v s(t) with that obtained from
0.3 v s(t)
(b)	Is the system time invariant? Explain.
